        "<p>The 'OpenStreetMap in Schools' project looks at introducing OpenStreetMap and open mapping techniques in schools to bolster the learning of geography while increasing the uptake of STEM education in schools.</p> <p>OSM Uganda will execute the project in 4 districts: Kisoro, Terego, Arua City, and Arua district, located in the South Western and West Nile regions of Uganda. Building on the OpenStreetMap in Schools pilot training that OpenStreetMap Uganda and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) carried out in 2018, OpenStreetMap Uganda plans to revitalize these activities across 8 schools with plans to scale up the project each year. The OpenStreetMap in Schools project is targeting 200 teachers and 5,000 students across these secondary school institutions.</p> ",
